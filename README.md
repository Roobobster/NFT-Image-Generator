# NFT-Image-Generator

A Image layering script that can change the colorus of the layers seperately and layer them ontop of each other to generate custom image. Intended to be able to generate lots of NFT styled images although there is small chance for images to be exactly the same if generating extremely large amounts of images. But if you chanage the image labels to be the same as the properties of the image then this can be overcome as it will only overwrite the image if they are the same.

Just change the location at the top for the base location and the generated location and you can easily swap the images to make your own custom layerings, just make sure that they are all the same sized resolution, this one starts off using 50x50.
